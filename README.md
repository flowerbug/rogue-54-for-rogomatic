# Some History

  Rogue is an ancient computer game that I had spent way too much time playing back in the 1980s.

  Back then we could not run Rog-O-Matic in the computer lab but I had always wanted to see it run.  As an effort to do that more recently I came across the Rog-O-Matic Restored project by Anthony Molinaro and decided to try it out.  Included within the Rog-O-Matic code he included this version of Rogue.

  I copied it from the project Rog-O-Matic Restored and used revision 22 checked out from:

http://code.google.com/p/rogomatic/


 That has since been changed to:

https://code.google.com/archive/p/rogomatic/


  Thank You to Anthony Molinaro <anthonym@alumni.caltech.edu>


  To be clear Rogue and Rog-O-Matic are two different projects with different authors and different licenses.


# Current Status

  I am not working on Rogue much the past few years but the code is still being requested enough for download from my website that it should have a more public home.  As I have not yet applied all my changes to this repository yet and have to work through them the website http://www.anthive.com/project/rogue/ has the most recent version (5.4.4-ant-1.1.4).
