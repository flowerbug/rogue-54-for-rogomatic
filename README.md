# Some History

  Rogue is an ancient computer game that I had spent way too much time playing back in the 1980s.

  Back then we could not run Rog-O-Matic in the computer lab but I had always wanted to see it run.

  Many years later I came across the Rog-O-Matic Restored project by Anthony Molinaro and included along with the Rog-O-Matic code was this version of Rogue.

  I checked out revision 22 from:

http://code.google.com/p/rogomatic/


 That has since been changed to:

https://code.google.com/archive/p/rogomatic/


  Thank You to Anthony Molinaro <anthonym@alumni.caltech.edu>


# Note

  To be clear Rogue and Rog-O-Matic are two different projects with different authors and different licenses.


# Current Status

  I am not working on Rogue much the past few years but the code is still being downloaded enough from my website that it should have a more public home.

  As I have not yet applied all my changes to this repository and have to work through them the website http://www.anthive.com/project/rogue/ has the most recent version (5.4.4-ant-1.1.4).
